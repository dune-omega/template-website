                  <span
                    >Mothers know best... <br /><br />
                    We were almost giving up on having our condo unit rented
                    because of the many issues we have had with renters, paying
                    mortgage, paying tax, paying dues…the list continues. We
                    were living abroad and on one vacation in Manila, we were
                    approached by an agent who offered to sublease our unit to
                    guests. They offered guaranteed rent but for a fraction of
                    the rent we could potentially get. I told my mother the
                    offer and she said, let me do that myself it so you don’t
                    need to sacrifice on the rental price. Before we know it we
                    had another friend of ours whose mother doesn’t live nearby,
                    so he asked if my mother could help him too. And one thing
                    leads to another.
                    <br /><br />
                    We employ the experience we had living overseas and seeing
                    how agents and property companies in Singapore, Australia
                    and UK handle properties under their care. This comes with
                    the hope that in the future more Philippine property owner
                    will see the advantage of having their units handled by
                    professionals instead of dealing with all the issues
                    themselves.

					<h3 data-animate="fadeInUp">Strategy</h3>
					<span>At <strong>Kondo Ko.</strong>, we believe that there is no one winning formula for all properties. We will study the area your condo is located, we will profile your market, review market rates, and advice what is the best plan of action. As with any business, your rental business need to have a business plan.
					<br /><br />
					If needed, we will switch from one package to another for your condo depending on peak and down season, depending on your cash flow needs, depending on your risk appetite, and current furnishing in your unit.
					<br /><br />
					Short stay rentals in average earn between 20% - 50% more compared to a traditional long term lease, but this might not work for all condos as profit varies depending on various factors. So while we are waiting for a long-term tenant that suits your profile, we will do short-term bookings or vice-versa, with your approval. We do this to lessen the down time of your property so it gets to earn as much as it could.

            We understand that owning a condominium property in Metro Manila can
            be such a hassle and sometimes it does not yield as much income as
            we hoped it would. Sometimes you pay the condo dues every month even
            if you don’t have a renter. The bills just keep on filling. We share
            your sentiments and that's why we have come up with packages and
            services that can help you achieve the full potential of your
            property. We will be your partner from sign-up until you sell your
            property. <br /><br />
            As property owners ourselves, we had experienced all the pains of
            owning and running a condo. If you have had enough of renters who
            doesn't pay on time, leaves utility bills unpaid? If you just don’t
            have the time or resources to market your condo for short term
            airbnb-type rentals, if you are after a particular profile for your
            longterm tenant, or if you just really want to sell your condo to
            get rid of all the hassle...
            <br /><br />
            Then you've come to the right place! No matter the situation we will
            take care of it.
